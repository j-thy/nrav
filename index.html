   <b>The NFL Rushing Attempts Visualization Tool (NRAV)</b> is a tool for visualizing the yardage gained and success of
   each play an NFL running back makes in a game. <b>NRAV</b> runs on the command-line and parses through play-by-play
   data supplied by nflfastR-data, a repository of NFL play-by-play data on GitHub from the 1999 NFL season all the way
   to the current 2020 NFL season. It overlays the yardage gained for each rushing play of a specified NFL player onto a
   football field, sorted from closest to the goal line to furthest based on the line of scrimmage. The line of
   scrimmage and first down marker for each play are also clearly marked, along with any scoring plays and fumbles lost.
   <p>
      Each play is represented by a vertical bar, which begins at the line of scrimmage for that play and ends where the
      rusher is downed, fumbles the ball, or enters the endzone for a score. Each play is color coded for the "success"
      of the play.
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li>Green: Scoring play - touchdown or successful 2 point conversion</li>
      <li>Light Green: First down converted</li>
      <li>Yellow: Short of a first down</li>
      <li>Orange: Tackled in the backfile for a loss</li>
      <li>Red: Fumbled the ball, which is recovered by the defending team</li>
   </ul>
   <p>
      You run <b>NRAV</b> with

      <table border="3" cellpadding="3">
         <tbody>
            <tr>
               <td>
                  <pre>nrav [output-file] [rusher-name] [week] [season]</pre>
               </td>

      NRAV takes three input arguments:
   <ul>
      <li>The name of the rusher. The name is formatted as "FI.Last_Name" (FI: first initial). Must be the name of an
         NFL player who has played at least one game in the 1999 NFL season or beyond. For example, Derrick Henry is
         D.Henry.</li>
      <li>The week the game being analyzed in the NFL season. Must be between 1 and 21 (inclusive). (the NFL postseason
         is Week 18-21) For example, Derrick Henry's first game of the season would be Week 1. The AFC Conference
         Championship would be Week 20. </li>
      <li>The year of the NFL season. Must be between 1999 and the current NFL season year (inclusive). Keep in mind,
         the NFL postseason usually takes place in the number year after, but it is still considered part of the
         previous number year's season.</li>
   </ul>
   </p>
   <p>
      <b>NRAV</b> makes calls to <b>curl</b> (downloading the raw archived .csv file from GitHub) and <b>gunzip</b>
      (decompressing the archive into a .csv file), and those programs need to be installed as a prerequisite. The
      <b>jgraph</b> program also needs to be in a directory called <b>"jgraph"</b>, and the <b>jgraph</b> directory must
      be in the same directory as the <b>NRAV</b> executable.

      This program was tested on hydra3.eecs.utk.edu.

   <h2>NRAV Examples</h2>

   Here are some examples of NRAV outputs and what they can tell us about a particular running back's performance in a
   game.

   <pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>nrav henry D.Henry 14 2018</b></font></pre>

   Here is the jgraph and the JPEG:

   <p></p>
   <center>
      <table border="3" cellpadding="3">
         <tbody>
            <tr>
               <td><img src="./img/henry.jpg" width="500"></td>
            </tr>
         </tbody>
      </table>
   </center>

   <p>
      You can tell that Derrick Henry, the RB for the Tennessee Titans, in Week 14, 2020 against the Jaguars, was used
      quite evenly across the field in various yardage situations. He was also able to pull off touchdowns from any part
      of the field, even having a 99-yard touchdown where he was able to use his stiff arm ability and top end speed to
      break away when most others could not.
   </p>

   <p>Next, take a look at Dalvin Cook in Week 1, 2020 against the Packers:</p>
   <pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>nrav cook D.Cook 1 2020</b></font></pre>

   <p></p>
   <center>
      <table border="3" cellpadding="3">
         <tbody>
            <tr>
               <td><img src="./img/cook.jpg" width="500"></td>
            </tr>
         </tbody>
      </table>
   </center>

   <p>
      Dalvin Cook was incredibly effective in the redzone, with 4 out of 5 of his attempts inside the opponent's 5 yard
      line resulting in a score. Otherwise, he wasn't utilized as much outside the redzone, with the Vikings relying
      more on the pass game.
   </p>

   <p>Next, take a look at Ezekiel Elliott in Week 6, 2020 against the Cardinals:</p>
   <pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>nrav zeke E.Elliott 6 2020</b></font></pre>

   <p></p>
   <center>
      <table border="3" cellpadding="3">
         <tbody>
            <tr>
               <td><img src="./img/zeke.jpg" width="500"></td>
            </tr>
         </tbody>
      </table>
   </center>

   <p>
      Ezekiel Elliott, an elite running back in years past, has been struggling this season, particularly with fumbles.
      The graph shows us that he wasn't able to get any scores, with his only redzone carry resulting in lost yardage.
      Not only that, he also had a fumble, which he had been struggling with all season. What this graph doesn't show is
      that he had a second fumble from a shovel pass behind the line of scrimmage. However, because it was a pass, even
      if Elliott received it behind line of scrimmage, it isn't a run play and doesn't show up on the visualization.
   </p>

   <p>Lastly, take a look at Rudi Johnson in Week 10, 2003 against the Texans:</p>
   <pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>nrav johnson R.Johnson 10 2003</b></font></pre>

   <p></p>
   <center>
      <table border="3" cellpadding="3">
         <tbody>
            <tr>
               <td><img src="./img/johnson.jpg" width="500"></td>
            </tr>
         </tbody>
      </table>
   </center>

   <p>
      These inputs were chosen more to test the limits of the program. This game is notable in that it has the most
      rushing attempts by a single rusher in a game of any game in the 1999 NFL season and beyond. It is also an older game, 2003,
      which tests if older data still accurate. However, it also tells another story: the NFL was far more run-heavy in
      times past, and comparing the number of attempts in this graph to the ones above really shows how the NFL has
      become more of a passing league in the modern era.
